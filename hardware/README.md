# Hardware

The hardware was designed in KiCAD. It is centered around the ATMega328P and features an MCP23017. I'm attempting to replicate the functionality of TR-808, but with simplified circuitry on the control side of things. The intention is to match the analog voice circuits with the original 808 as closely as possible, but I'll let the ATMega chip, with its built in timers and a2d functionality, handle tempo adjustment which were analog on the 808.
